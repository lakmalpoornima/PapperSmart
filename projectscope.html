      <h3>Literature Survey</h3>

      <p class="pad_bot1 color1">Computer vision technology aids in identifying plant infection by capturing images and detecting pests and diseases, replacing outdated methods in agriculture(4).

        Plant infection, which are caused by elements like temperature, bacteria, and surrounding crops and manifest early through physical changes in plants, interrupt important processes and are harmful to their health(5)(6).Plant diseases have an effect on plant development and food supply(6).
        
        Research studies use a variety of techniques to discover plant diseases, influencing development and identifying variables affecting plant growth.
        
        In academic studies, plant diseases are identified and categorised using feature extraction, image processing, and SVM classifiers. These articles also address the issue of unbalanced data and investigate transfer learning methodologies for edge computing solutions(6)(7).
        
        <br>
        <br>

        A computer vision system that detects plant illnesses has a 93% accuracy rate and an average F1 score of 0.93. This strategy is computationally efficient and more precise than alternative approaches because it makes use of statistical image processing and machine learning models. For experts in vegetable pathology and pattern recognition, this article offers a thorough introduction(8)(9). Deep learning was used by researchers in 2021 to better diagnose plant diseases using a variety of ML techniques.(10).
        
        For the analysis and detection of plant leaf diseases, K.M. Mamatha, Seema Sing, and S.A. Hariprasad presented a convolutional neural network. The network examines pictures using a variety of strategies, concentrating on the leaves that are most susceptible to strain. Leaf samples are used as the dataset. For reliable results, pre-processed characteristics are used(11).
        
        A CNN method for diagnosing plant diseases using image processing was created by Sinha and Shekhawat in 2020. To detect NLB lesions in cropped photos, they developed a heat map and trained several CNNs(12). Four deep learning models that were trained on plant leaves fared better than earlier techniques in terms of accuracy and loss while identifying plant diseases(13).
        
        Sri Lanka's agriculture sector is essential for generating employment and ensuring food security. Secure bioconditions are necessary for the growth of healthy plants and the avoidance of disease in crops cultivated in polytunnels(14). Farmers depend on the leaf area index, but hand counting is time-consuming and challenging, hence automated technological alternatives are being investigated(15).
        
        Accurate ecophysiological evaluations and gas exchange in mid-latitude forests and shrublands need leaf tissue area (LAI). Polytunnels offer crop protection, however it might be difficult to maintain a secure bio environment. Automation for assessing plant health and boosting output is made possible by robotics, sensors, and AI technology. These instruments support problem-solving, damage minimization, and crop health surveillance. Robots using cameras can classify weeds, use less pesticides, and keep an eye on the health of crops to stop the spread of disease.
        
        The digital agricultural revolution has transformed farming practises, boosting output and having positive effects on the environment. 
        
        <br>
        <br>

        Modern tools like sensors, GPS monitoring, and drones allow farmers to get real-time data on weather patterns, soil moisture, and crop growth rates. This Information enhances insect control, fertilisation, and irrigation, increasing crop yields and profitability. Efficiency and innovation are fostered by digitalization, which is fueled by trends like IoT and precision agriculture(16).
        
        In recent years, a number of venues for knowledge exchange have appeared. Information sharing platforms have advanced significantly as a new type of sharing economy, giving users additional avenues for Information acquisition, knowledge sharing, and personal knowledge storage. However, there are still issues with knowledge sharing platforms, such as inconsistent product quality (Content quality) and bad user experience(17).
        
        By encouraging Information exchange and agricultural innovation among farmers, professionals, academics, lawmakers, and consumers, social media helps to break down regional barriers and strengthen global connectivity.
        
        The most recent research has made progress in using computer vision to detect plant diseases. On the other hand, there is an enormous deficit in knowledge about the early diagnosis of powdery mildew in bell pepper crops by detecting the stressed level. While several research have looked into disease identification using deep learning and image processing, little focus has been placed on the unique difficulties posed by powdery mildew in bell pepper plants. By creating and evaluating the "PepperSmart" smart polytunnel system, which is particularly designed for the prompt detection and treatment of powdery mildew in bell pepper farming by recording the stressed level of the leaf, the current study aims to close this discrepancy. This targeted effort has the potential to promote sustainable farming methods inside Sri Lanka's crucial agriculture industry.</p>

      <h3>Research Gap</h3>

      <p class="pad_bot1 color1"> A significant body of research has explored various aspects of powdery mildew in bell pepper plants, including epidemiology, symptomatology, and treatment. However, several research gaps still exist, particularly regarding the use of advanced image analysis methods, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Mask R-CNN, and YOLOv8, to assess the degree of illness and the application of agrochemicals in bell pepper plants. While these deep learning techniques have shown promise in identifying and measuring plant diseases in other crops, there's a lack of comprehensive evaluation of their efficacy in bell pepper plants. Additionally, AI models and mobile apps have been developed to automate powdery mildew detection in bell pepper plants.

        This research highlights the potential of using CNN, Mask R-CNN, and YOLOv8 for assessing the severity of powdery mildew in bell pepper plants based on lesion patterns in photos. The proposed solution includes the development of a mobile application to enhance accessibility. Furthermore, it mentions "Smart Pepper's" API access, which allows other parties to interact with the services. The research emphasizes the importance of accurate methods in training the algorithm and suggests a pro version of the solution for achieving the highest accuracy.
        
        The lack of early detection of powdery mildew in bell pepper plants by first assessing plant stress is identified as a research gap. The paper also compares this work with other research papers in the field, highlighting the shift from traditional image processing and machine learning techniques to deep learning methods for plant disease and pest detection.
        
        Several studies using deep learning techniques, including CNN, InceptionV3, InceptionResnetV2, MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0, and SVM, have been cited for identifying various plant diseases and pests in different crops, demonstrating the versatility of deep learning in this context.
        
        Two additional studies outside the powdery mildew context focus on robotics, machine learning, and computer vision for plant monitoring in polytunnels. The first paper discusses the use of robotics and machine learning for disease identification and treatment in polytunnels using thermal imaging, while the second paper emphasizes estimating the leaf area index (LAI) of maize plants in polytunnels with machine learning and computer vision techniques. <a href="#" class="link1 pad_bot2">Read More</a> </p>

      <h3>Methodology</h3>

      <p class="pad_bot1 color1">
        PepperSmart is a smart polytunnel application designed for bell pepper farmers, offering disease detection, severity detection, plant leaf area index detection, and post shearing and commenting. It detects powdery mildew disease and recommends suitable medications for infected plants, enhancing yield and cost. This application is crucial for preventing powdery mildew and improving the overall quality of bell pepper plants.
  
  An infrared camera can identify the presence of powdery mildew by detecting stressed temperature. For early detection, high-resolution photos are essential. The software analyses each plant individually to measure stress levels and leaf area indices. The tool establishes a platform for Information exchange and use Auto ML to identify bell pepper plants that are disease-infected. The objective is to build a robot that can measure temperature and take pictures in order to diagnose and cure the illness.
  
  This research is proposed as a smart solution to the main four problems identified in the agricultural sector in Sri Lanka. Once the application is developed, it will be introduced to bell pepper farmers, industry experts, and researchers to use it in their affairs. This application will be a great help to bell pepper farmers to maximize the crop yield and the income they get.
  
  
  This study offers the bell pepper producers a rare chance to address their issues while maximizing their yields and revenue. The technology can be improved upon and modified for different products, dealing with more business issues.
  
   Stressed Level Detection / Powdery Mildew Disease Detection of Bell Pepper Leaves 
  
  This section focuses on a complete method that combines temperature data analysis and picture classification techniques to evaluate the health state of bell pepper plants. Two primary duties are noted,
  
   (1) Using temperature data to determine the degree of leaf stress. 
  
   (2) Using image classification to distinguish between healthy and sick bell pepper leaves. 
  
  Readings of the leaf temperature are gathered, and stress levels are calculated using a predefined threshold. To classify leaves into healthy and unhealthy categories, machine learning or deep learning models are applied. Combining these methodologies enables a thorough evaluation of plant health and the creation of powdery mildew infection management strategies.
  
   Data Collection and Processing 
  
  To identify stressed leaves, deep learning models were trained using temperature data and photos of bell pepper leaves. An extensive collection of leaf photos was captured with a high-resolution camera. The temperature of the bell pepper plants and their surroundings were continually measured using a thermal model.
  
  By examining temperature data, the study focuses on determining the stress levels in bell pepper leaves. To measure stress levels, the researchers utilised a preset threshold or algorithm. The photographs were shot in a polytunnel, which controlled the development of bell peppers at various phases. The photos were carefully chosen to capture the leaves precisely, and using image classification, stressed and healthy leaves were distinguished.
  
  
  
  Photographs of bell pepper leaves are manually annotated by plant health specialists to look for symptoms of stress and the disease powdery mildew. Machine learning algorithms or deep learning models are used to categorise leaves into groups that are healthy or powdery mildew-infected, image classification algorithms discern between healthy and diseased leaves. The first test focused on disease diagnosis and the second on identifying physiological stress. Combining these approaches offers a thorough assessment of bell pepper plant health, assisting in efficient management strategies.
  
   Image Classification / Training the detection models 
  
  By examining temperature data, the study focuses on determining the stress levels in bell pepper leaves. To measure stress levels, the researchers utilised a preset threshold or algorithm. Various stages of bell pepper growth were regulated in the polytunnel. The photos were carefully chosen to capture the leaves and using image classification, stressed and healthy leaves were distinguished.
  
  The study used a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to analyse the photos and categorise powdery mildew infection using TensorFlow, a machine learning framework. This technique made it easier to recognise stressed leaves and determine the degree of powdery mildew occurrence, which helped with a thorough evaluation of plant health.
  
  
  
   Severity Calculation of infected bell pepper Leaves 
  
  The recommended method outlines an organised approach for assessing the severity of powdery mildew on bell pepper plants. The association between infection levels and yield loss is explored after a detailed analysis of the background Information, with an emphasis on the need of early detection. A detailed analysis of sickness symptoms and their repercussions emphasises the need of employing effective treatment methods.
  
  The method then moves on to state-of-the-art technological choices, including TensorFlow and OpenCV-based AI-accelerated technologies that enable accurate severity analysis and pesticide optimisation. This serves as the foundation for the severity calculation approach, which is developed utilising methods like colour segmentation. 
  
  Automated chemical administration and disease progression assessment are crucial for accurate disease management. A smartphone app called "Smart Poly Tunnel Helpful Guide" uses image recognition and model integration for real-time evaluation, interactive maps, and educational content. The strategy prioritizes user feedback and offers economic and ecological benefits, highlighting the potential for affordable chemical uses beyond agriculture.
  
  As a result, this thorough methodology provides a comprehensive approach that integrates user involvement, technological innovation, and economic factors to provide a dependable answer for estimating the severity of powdery mildew in bell pepper plants while laying the foundation for upcoming improvements and advancements.
